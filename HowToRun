Make sure SteamVR is already running (you just need the headset to be active, it doesn't matter if the controllers are attached)
then run:

cd catkin_dev
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source devel/setup.bash
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH:/home/conrad/catkin_dev/devel/lib
roslaunch ohr_refresh main.launch

rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/rgb/image_raw

will have to change catkin_dev and your path to whatever it actually is on your computer.
